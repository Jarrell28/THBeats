# THBeats
Music E-Commerce Website

A music ecommerce website that I built for a family member. Users can sample music beats, select a service plan to upload their music to be mixed and mastered, add beats to cart and purchase beats using sandbox paypal. The owner has a admin side that allows him to update his music being displayed, view messages, orders, and google analytics chart directly from admin. Built using slim framework, twig's templating engine and laravel's eloquent ORM
